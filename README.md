This Python script does rudimentary sentiment analysis on tweets with the keyword 'Bitcoin'.
Original Script Credit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/

The script is also updated to append to a csv file in order to capture a history of bitcoin sentiment. It would be interesting to see whether there is a correlation between the numbers and price ($$$). 

You can run it everyday to capture some data and then analyze it to see if there is a trend.
